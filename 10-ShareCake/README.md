# `10` Share the Cake

## Instructions ðŸ—’
1. Create a function `sliceOfCake`that determines whether or not it's possible to share the cake fairly given these three parameters: `Total slices`, `Recipients`, `Slices` each.
2. It's fine not to use the entire cake. 
3. Print `true` if the cake can be shared equally, otherwise print `false`.
